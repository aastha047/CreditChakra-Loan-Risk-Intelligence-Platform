Project Description:

CreditChakra is a comprehensive loan risk analysis project that examines 140,000+ real-world loan records to uncover patterns and key factors influencing loan defaults and approvals. Using robust data analysis and visualization techniques, the project provides actionable insights to help financial institutions evaluate borrower credit risk and optimize lending strategies.

Key achievements include identifying high-risk borrower segments, understanding the impact of credit score and income on default probability, and generating clear, data-backed insights that guide credit decision making.

This project demonstrates my ability to perform advanced data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and derive meaningful business insights from complex financial datasets.

✔ Identified major determinants of loan default

✔ Visualized relationships between variables such as credit score, income, loan amount, and default outcomes

✔ Segmented borrower groups to reveal high-risk profiles

✔ Provided risk insights applicable to credit risk strategy and lending decisions


Tools & Technologies Used:

Python – data manipulation and analysis
